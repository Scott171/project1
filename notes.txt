I know you mentioned we may not be able to do online payments, would that also be true for having people place orders online? 
That might sound like a dumb question, but I'm trying to figure out a way for the storefront to communicate with the actual bakery 
(they are in different locations) online rather than how we currently are doing with paper orders. 
If that's too much, or too complicated, then no worries!
